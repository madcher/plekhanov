It is a flag of   the Shias - the followers in Islam who consider Ali   (cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Mohammed) as their Founder. The Shias (the name comes from Arabic Shiatu Ali - Party of Ali) think that All was the one who opened the innermost meaning of Koran and   became the first Imam (spiritual leader) of the Muslims. The knowledge is   conveyed only through the direct descendants of Ali and his wife Fatima   (Prophet's daughter) Approximately one tenth of almost   one billion Muslims living world­wide are Shias. The   city of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Najaf</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> (in Arabic: hill) is as holy as </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Mecca</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> for them, as this city was created   around the hill where Ali was buried.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Every Shia   thinks that it is a great honour to be buried in Najaf. The remains of all wealthy followers of this branch   are still shipped there. One of the last descendants of   Prophet Mohammed - Ali Shah Aga Khan U. the 47th Imam   was buried there. However, his right to be Imam is recognised only by 15 million Shia Muslims who call themselves Ismailis. All that has to do with the   genealogical tree of the descendants of the Prophet. The Shias had lots of disagreements in   this matter and got divided into sects and the sects got divided into smaller   units due to new differences. The entirely legitimate Imams were the ones who   received the spiritual power in accordance with the custom of giving it to the   eldest son of Imam or the next generation but necessarily in the same family. In   spite of different interpretations in Islam they all   peacefully get on with the followers worship the same sacred objects. The red   flag of the Shia and the green flag of Islam do not   deny one another.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Every Friday the successor of Aga Khan II used ю sit facing the direction of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Mecca</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> for one hour and contemplated about   the heritage of the Prophet. Being his direct descendant he considered himself responsible for the destiny   of Islam which entered the world at the time of wars, revolutions and   destruction of great empires. Aga Khan III the head of   the Ismailis had run the community for such a long   period that his term did not only cover different centuries of the European   calendar but different historical epochs. The life in 1885 when Aga Khan II was buried in Najaf was not very different from the life in 632 when the   Prophet died. But by 1957 when Aga Khan III passed away the world was going through   tremendous changes. Realising the complexity of the tasks before his followers   the Old Imam appointed his 20 уеar-old grandson, a   student of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Harvard</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">University</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> ю be his   successor.</span></p>

              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The history of lsmailism is rich in personalities and developments that   could make heroes and themes of a number of breathtaking novels. A chain of   blood-related rulers, leaders and mutineers went through the history of the   Near and Middle East stalling from (he son of All.   Husain who was killed during the battle with the   forces of the throne usurper, up to the time of Aga   Khan I who governed the Iranian </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">province</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kirman</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> at the beginning of the 19th century and then rose against his suzerain and left for </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">India</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> with a group of his followers.   Some personalities of that chain were remembered by their   descendants as great creators, others as warriors and the third ones had   only their names remembered. As far as the latter ones concerned they were the so-called hidden Imams who lived at   the time of persecution.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The Ismaili Imams managed to unite the spiritual and secular   power several times. In the 10th and I 11th centuries the Ismaili dynasty of Faiimites ruled   in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Egypt</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. That period was the rise of the   Islamic civilisation. The Ismaili caliphs founded </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Cairo</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and turned it to the best city of   the East - the centre of culture and education. At the end of the 11th century (he Ismailis created a   state in the mountainous areas of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Iran</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Syria</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. And that   particular state became famous and known to the Europeans, as the liming of its   creation coincided with (lie formation of a number of kingdoms and counties of   the crusaders. Sharing the border with the land of the Ismailis the Europeans got   acquainted with their hierarchy and methods of governing.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Being surrounded by the hostile   Sunnis the Shias often used the principle of   concealment (taqiyyah) which guaranteed their safely.   Taqiyyah made provision for a possibility of   worshipping of the ruling version of Islam for the sake of preservation of the   secret knowledge and its propaganda in the conditions of spiritual and physical   terror by the authorities. In their aspiration to secure themselves from the   infiltrating agents of the enemy the Ismailis worked out a unique system of the consecration   phases to the secrets of their teachings which allowed them to get that   Knowledge after spending several decades in the community. The method of this   propaganda in the hostile environment was so refined that the Ismaili Da’i (missionary) could   attract the most intellectual persons of independent thinking of the enemy in a   convenient way.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The Fatimites ruled </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Egypt</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and a number of neighbouring areas   of the Near East and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">North Africa</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. The House of Wisdom which   existed in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Cairo</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> at that   lime</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> represented   an educational centre where Da'is were trained. Their   task was to convey the message of the Ismailis to the   world. According ю the cosmogonic conception in the   system of which digit 12 was one of the universal ones the Earth was divided into 12 "islands" inhabited by different nations.   One of the islands was inhabited by the Slavic people.   It is interesting to know that one of most famous caliphs of this dynasty<strong> - Hakim</strong> (996-1020) was born from a   Russian mother. He became notorious for his wild and extravagant behaviour&nbsp; to be   matched with Nero. But he paid lots of attention to the   propaganda of the Ismaili doctrines outside his   country. After he mysteriously disappeared (he   disappeared in one of the suburbs of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Cairo</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> when he was riding his donkey one   evening) one of the Ismaili communities in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Syria</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> surfed worshipping him as a hidden   Imam who will return to Earth at the end of life. The above-mentioned community   still exists under the name of the Druzes (from the   word Darazi. 2 missionary sent personally by Hakim to   that region which at present is divided by the borders   of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Lebanon</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Israel</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Syria</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">).<a name="mem" id="mem"></a></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   grandson </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">of   Hakim - Caliph al.Mustansir   (1035-1095)-deprived_his eldest son from the throne   and that led to a new schism; a group of Ismailis who   were faithful to Nizar and his descendants called   themselves the Nizaris. And   so today they are headed by the Aga   Khan.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The followers of Nizar left for </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Iran</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> relying on the wide branching net   of the Da'is and opened an energetic campaign. And so in 1090-1092 during a powerful people's riot they   managed to occupy a number of fortresses in the mountainous areas of the country   which created the strong points of a new state that had no analogues in the   history. The stale of the Ismailis did not have one   and indivisible territory and represented a number of divided enclaves in   different pans of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Iran</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Syria</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. During the first decades this territory of castles was ruled by governor-generals of the   Imams who were "underground" Only the forth descendant of Nizar declared himself as a legitimate ruler - Imam.   It happened in 1162. Those Ismailis who ruled the   state on behalf of the hidden Imams became notorious for their refined methods   of fighting with the neighbouring countries. With the help of incredibly   dedicated death-sentenced prisoners - the Fidais -   they kept the Muslim as well as the Christian governors in fear. The Fidais used hashish before conducting terrorist acts and for   this reason were called Hashishiyun. This word entered European languages in a   distorted form as assassin. Up to now this word is used   to describe a terrorist in the English and French   languages.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The knight orders   which appeared during the crusades and developed in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Palestine</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> borrowed lots of things from the   Ismailis - from the organisational structure to the   mystic doctrines and methods of preservation of the secrets. The elements of   these esoteric teachings can be seen in the teachings   of the Templars. Hospitaliers and the Knights of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Malta</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> The European kings and dukes w ho fought in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Palestine</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> were greatly impressed by the   mysterious assassins. The images of desperate terrorists became the objects of   admiration of the European troubadours and minnersingers who sang of their dedication and   bravery.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Extravagant personalities such as   Hakim were an exception among the Imams-ancestors of the Aga Khan. The majority of them were fine politicians,   courageous warriors, philosophers and mystics. Although they all had different   characters, inclinations, temperaments the realisation of their religious   mission was the main thing for all of them.&nbsp;   That particular factor ensured the dynasty's unprecedented ability to   survive which managed to be in power several limes but most of 13 centuries of   its existence it remained to be the spiritual power to keep the Ismailis living all over the Muslim world   united.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The last bulwarks of the state of   Ismailis fell at the second half of the 13th century:   the fortress of Alamut in the   mountains of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Iran</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> was conquered by   the Mongols</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and   the Syrian castles were destroyed by Sultan Baibars of   Mameluke. Since then the long line (row) of the Imams   - heirs of glory of the Fatimites and the governors of   Alamut had become the dynasty without a state. Its   representatives were either highly respected and lived peacefully or were in   exile and had to move from one country to another as it happened to Aga Khan I who initially was in charge of the Iranian   province of Kirman and after rising against the Shah   government he had to emigrate to British India (1838).</span></p>
              <p><strong><u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">THE   PEAK OF THE EPOCH</span></u></strong></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The title of Aga Khan (In Persia it meant<strong> Great</strong> Leader) became famous to the   world due to the grandson of a Persian aristocrat who ran away from the Shah's   revenge. Sultan Mohammed Aga Khan III who headed the   Ismailis Community from 1885 to 1957 was the first   representative of the Eastern elite and became a member of the club of the   Western elite. His enormous political experience, personal charm, wide   connections in different countries allowed him to play an important role at the   turning points of the history of the modern world.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Being one of the leaders of the   Muslim League of India Aga Khan III encouraged the   solution of the critical inter-confessional conflicts in the British colonies.   Early 1930-s he headed the delegation of this League at the round-table   Conference in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">London</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> which</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> created   the foundation for working out the Constitution of India. The perspective   outcome of this conference was the declaration of independence of the colony and   its division into two states • </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">India</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Pakistan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. In 1937-1938 Aga Khan III was elected the President of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">League of   Nations</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and   in this capacity he actively attempted to prevent the   world war. During his meetings with Hitler in Berchtesgaden and with Goebbels in   Berlin he had an opportunity to find out what the intentions of the Germans were   but like other senior politicians he failed to guess in advance the developments   in Europe after his attempts to pacify Germany.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">During World War II the Aga Khan firmly supported   the Anti-German coalition and his son Ali served in the British   Army.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   post-war period greatly changed the life of the Ismaili community when the whole world was preoccupied with   grand changes. When the British colonial empire broke up the subjects of   the-Imam became citizens of a number of states. The main task of Aga Khan III was to develop the areas of education,   healthcare and economic independence of the Ismailis.   That is the way they could take their deserved place in the   rapidly changing world.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The Persian Shah recognised the   right of the dynasty of the Ismaili Imams for the   title of Royal Highness (Aga Khan I<strong> </strong>was the son-in-law of the Monarch) and   in the 20th century the title of His Royal Highness was given   to Aga Khan III by the British Queen. The   descendant of the Prophet was accepted as a member of the club of the world   elite and after his eldest son Ah married the daughter of Lord Churston whose origin comes from   the English King Edward Ш (1327-1377) one of the most ancient aristocratic   families of the East became related with the aristocracy of the West. Prince   Karim who<strong> </strong>was born from this marriage became the heir of the Imamat in accordance with the will Aga Khan III who died in July 1957.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The will of his grandfather was a   shock for a 20 year-old student of the Harvard University, h was not easy to   take heavy responsibilities for the multi-million community of the Ismailis spread over 25 countries of different continents by   a person who had a problem-free life of an American student and was an offspring   of the wealthiest family?!</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Aga</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Khan III explained his decision:   "In view of the fundamentally altered conditions in the world in very recent   years ... I am convinced that it is in the interest of the Shia Muslim Ismaili community that   I should be succeeded by a young man who has been brought up and developed   during the recent years and in the midst of the new age and who brings a new   outlook to his office as Imam".</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Prince Karim. a superbly educated person, brought up in the bosom of the   Western culture had to continue the work of this grandfather who put forward the   tasks before him ю introduce the Ismailis to the   values of the new lime and make provision for them to enter the modern   community. That was an extremely complicated task, particularly if one takes   into account the fact that most of the countries where the Ismailis lived - </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">South Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and Tropical Africa - belonged ю the group of   backward colonies of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">British empire</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. All-round education, including education of   the women, introduction of the modem methods of economic activities and   development of the capitalist initiatives of the nationals - that is how the old   Imam saw the introduction of the community ю the modern   civilisation.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Aga</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Khan IV has fully justified the hopes of his   predecessor It is difficult to imagine a person who is mostly involved in the   activities of his community. Those who have met Prince Karim say that he is constantly busy with reading lots of papers, having talks, inspecting different projects   created by a number of commercial and charitable organisations functioning under   the general leadership of the Imam.</span></p>
              <p><u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">THE SPIRITUAL   EMPIRE</span></u></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">As a   rule.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> one would use the u-ord "empire" to   describe a state uniting several imions. When we talk   about the Ismailis who live all over the world, they   belong to different races and nationalities and speak many languages but we   still call them the nationals of the Aga Khan. The   empire with no common territory, governing structures (typical of a slate) is   cemented, first of all, by the spiritual authority of   the leader.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Since according to the view of the   Ismailis the innermost meaning of Mohammed's Koran   was opened only by Ali therefore, his descendants-Imams   have been conveying the concealed knowledge. Hence, the religious meaning of the   personality of the Imam is more important for the community than the Pope of   Rome for his congregation. The faith in the spiritual light coming from the Imam   ensured the stability and survival of the Ismaili   community despite those multi-century persecutions. And the time swallowed   dozens of other sects and even very powerful confessions such as the followers   of Zoroaster (fire-worshippers of Iran) or the Sabaeans of Mesopotamia which turned to minor erotic   communities scattered all over the world.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">In the Middle Ages the Ismailis created an   unparalleled system of propaganda of their doctrines. They bad worked for   decades among people provoking religious debates and involving the   representatives of the Sunni clergy into disputations. The Ismaili Da'is produced a number of   prominent thinkers and writers such us Nasir Khusraw and al-Kirmani. They also mention Ibn Sina (Avicenna) as one of the   famous Ismaili scientists.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">But</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> in accordance with the instruction to follow   the path of modernisation and introduction of the community ю the spirit of the   dynamic 20th century the attitude of the Ismailis   towards the methods of conveying their spiritual heritage has changed. In the   distant past due to their<strong> </strong>fear of   repression the Knowledge was conveyed according to the   phase of consecration of an Ismaili to the secret   doctrines. Today all ancient and modern books of their theologians and   philosophers are freely published and   studied.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">In the late 1977 the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Institute</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Ismaili</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Studies</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> was opened in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">London</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. One of its tasks was to collect   and publish ail Ismaili manuscripts. Hundreds of books   of theologians, philosophers, alchemists of the past have   already been published. At the beginning of this century a restricted number of devotees had an<strong> </strong>access to the classic books like   "Peace of Mind" by al-Kirmani. Today the Institute   provides an opportunity for representatives of all religions to get acquainted with its collection and   library.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The London Institute is working on   the realisation of the programmes which create   conditions to study Ismailism in the wide cultural,   linguistic, ethnographic context. Islam is reviewed not only as a religion but as a special form of civilisation. And the development of the religious ideas is recognised as   one of the border lines of the development of the Muslim world. Besides, one of   the fundamental principles of learning the historical and spiritual realities is   to reject the superficial opposition of the East to the West. </span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">As for the methods of conveying of   the religious heritage, they are also studied by the   Institute. Today the Ismaili message is conveyed not through the Da'is   but through the modem information technologies prepared by qualified specialists   and teachers. As it is mentioned in one of the   information materials prepared by the propaganda institution of the Aga Khan Development Network the task of the education   department of the Institute is "to turn the religious education into a creative   and fascinating process for the young generation proportionally promoting   other<strong> </strong>areas by using modem   principles and methods of teaching". It is unlikely that one could<strong> </strong>see such a modem way of studying and   teaching of the religion anywhere else in the Islamic   world.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">For the years after the break-up of   the British colonial empire and the formation of a number of states the Ismaili community has   become more united and influential in spite of the borders that divided it. The   Ismailis were persecuted in a   number of states, which were headed by extreme nationalists. It happened in 1962   in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Burma</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and in 1972 in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Uganda</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. The subjects of the Aga Khan left their homes for </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">America</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. And today   the}' have successfully integrated in the Western society without losing their   culture or as we say their identity. The focus of the Aga Khan III and his successor on educational programmes and   development of the economic independence of the Ismailis has proved to be the right one. The new time did   not take them unawares. The spiritual empire of the Aga Khan is entering the 21st century as a full-blooded   (sanquineous) and dynamically developing community   with clear prospects in mind. But the process of   modernisation has become very painful for many nations and religious communities   of the East and some communities have even remained at the periphery of   development.</span></p>
              <p align="left"><u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">HEAVENLY AND   EARTHLY</span></u><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"></span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The uniqueness of the Aga Khan among the modem leaders of the world is not only in   his high moral authority for his subjects. The Development Network created by   him unites different institutions in the field of economy, social and cultural   spheres and represents a special structure which docs not only cover the   interests of the Ismaili community. For instance, the   Aga Khan Trust for Culture focuses on two basic   directions - development of the Islamic architecture and restoration of the   historical cities and certain architectural objects. The Aga Khan Award which is granted once in   three<strong> </strong>years in the field of   architecture serves the creative development of the town-planning ideas   according to the traditions of Islam.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Just think of those cities and countries which are under the care of the Trust for Culture.   The Aga Khan is not only concerned about the   preservation of the cultural heritage of the Ismailis.   The notorious Registan in Samarkand and the Old Town in Zanzibar, the fort of Baltit in Pakistan and Zafra House   in Spanish Granada, architectural memorials of Tunisia, Egypt. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Turkey</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">India</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Yemen</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> - they all belong 10 the mankind.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">With the passage of lime the Imams have become less preoccupied with the issues   of the spiritual leadership and the cultural heritage due to the earthly matters   of the community. The focus of the Aga Khan on the   development of economic structures, healthcare, education has led to the   creation of a chain of inter-linked programmes. The financial   institutions, industrial and agricultural objects. educational institutions and hospitals functioning within the   framework of the Development Network&nbsp;   define the every day life of the Ismailis<u>.</u> By collaborating with dozens of   international and national organisations, governments and private charities in   the realisation of its programmes the Aga Khan   Development Network has become an influential force of the modem world and a   bridge between the developed and developing countries where the Ismailis play a significant role.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The educational, medical,   consultative institutions of the Aga Khan Development   Network help the population of many developing countries regardless of their   nationality and religion. Significant investments have been   made in the tourism and publishing industries in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kenya</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Tanzania</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. Several projects have been   implemented in the field of agriculture in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Pakistan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">India</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> which</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> enabled   them to considerably increase the productivity of traditional   crops.</span></p>

              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">After the only visit of Aga Khan III to </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">St.   Petersburg</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Moscow</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> in 1912   our country had become a white patch for the Ismaili   Imams, although the territory of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">USSR</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> was compactly populated by the   community of the followers of this direction of Islam. The Pamiri peoples speaking different Indo-European languages   are united by their common religion. The Aga Khan is a supreme religious and secular authority for   200 thousand Pamiris. Even that multi-decade spiritual   isolation from the rest of the world has failed ю weaken their convictions,   although the Imam himself has turned to a semi-mythical figure for   them.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Only in 1995 Aga Khan IV got acquainted with </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Russia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and then with his religious   followers in the Pamirs. His meetings with the Prime   Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, parliamentary and religious   dignitaries, scientific and public officials in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Moscow</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> provided an opportunity ю establish   understanding in many areas, including the matter of restoration of peace in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Tajikistan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. They also discussed the issue of   preservation of neighbourly relations with the countries of the Islamic world   taking into account the complicated situation in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Chechnya</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   office of the Aga Khan Foundation has been opened in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Moscow</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> in order to keep in touch with </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Russia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.

There are also possibilities for interaction in the field of   culture and education, in the realisation of economic projects, although now one   can talk only about the first steps in the mentioned   directions.</span></p>
              <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The recent visit of the Imam of the   Ismailis to </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Moscow</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is evidence of his keen attention   to </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Russia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.

        <p><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Oman</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> Daily Observer, </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Saturday   6 January 2001</span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The land here is as flat as a table.   In the old times the owner of a <em>yurta</em>, a nomad habitation, could   see a horseman approaching from a dozen miles, and had enough time to knife a   sheep and make a <em>beshbarmak</em> by the time the guest   arrived. Any bush or small hill became a landmark serving to verify the way   along the endless steppe. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Until the   mid-1950s it was a virgin land. The richest black soil   covering hundreds of thousands of square kilometres had never   been ploughed. Only herds of wild animals and flocks of shepherd tribes   wandered across the lowlands searching for food and water. Nikita&nbsp; Khruschev, obsessed by a passion for revolutionary   transformations, began a campaign to master the untouched lands – Tselina. Huge masses of people and agricultural machinery   were transported here to assure a powerful breakthrough   in grain production. Over a million German deportees, sent to the Kazakh steppes   under Stalin, became members of the Tselina   epic.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   dusty plain town of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Akmolinsk</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> became the administrative centre of the Tselina.   Thousands of barracks and standard five storey houses, nicknamed khruschoba lined up in the bare steppe. This rather   unattractive assemblage of buildings was named </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Tselinograd</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> (they say that Khrusciov did not like the translation   of the Turkic name Akmolinsk – White Tomb). But this formal name did not last long – three decades later   the town was renamed to Astana, which stands simply for a   “capital”.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At   the entrance to Astana a barrow is raised, at the top   of which there is a stele – a monument to the victims of political repression.   Thus, the new capital of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Republic</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> seems to personify a challenge to its Soviet past. Not only do the constructions   have symbolic sense,&nbsp;   everything seems to be a metaphor of harrowing liberation from the   grip of the past. New traits are growing through the old profile. Where now&nbsp; dozens of both   local and foreign construction firms are involved in making transformations, the   Soviet empire standard still dominates with endless shabby blocks, miserable   dusty poplars along badly paved asphalt streets. But   the advantage of the buildings that are brilliant with glass and steel are made   still more evident. Over two years more luxury hotels, offices, banks, trade   complexes and leisure centres have been built here than ever before. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   main engine behind the transformations is the president of the republic Nursultan Nazarbaev. Not every   politician would dare to realize such an ambitious project as to build a new   capital in a severe steppe, where winter temperatures reach minus 40, and dust   storms rage in the summer. This task seems even more difficult in a country that   is experiencing a deep economy slump. Therefore, Nazarbaev had to overcome desperate resistance to   transferring the capital from the beautiful and comfortable city of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Almaty</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   which is situated in the green foothills far in the   south.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> seems an island of stability amid its neighbouring countries that have lived   through&nbsp; wars   and attacks by terrorist groups. It has also avoided large   scale ethnic conflicts, notwithstanding the multinational composition of   the population. Nazarbaev artfully avoids nationalist   trials, he is a leader who looks to the future. It is   difficult to identify another president so purposefully moving towards the   building of a modern state.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   favourite political-ideological terms of President Nazarbaev are globalisation and Eurasianism. If the former is well comprehensive in the west   thanks to its frequent use by the high-ranking officers of the American   administration, the latter is only truly familiar to intellectuals. Its meaning   is that the traditions and the political order of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp; reflect</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> its dual nature of a crossroads between the cultures of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   This is the context that frequent declarations by president   Nazarbaev about a particular way for </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and about the need for gradual and cautious democratic transformations should be   seen in</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">At   the entrance of the presidential study there are two   portraits. One depicts khan Abylay, who lived at the   beginning of the 18th century. He headed the struggle of Kazakh tribes against   the aggressive state of Jungaria. The other portrait   is of khan Abdulhair who in 1731 adopted Russian   citizenship, which assured the survival of the Kazakhs in the face of the Jungar threat. It seems logical to interpret the presence of   these images in the head of state’s residence as an expression of his devotion   to an independent development in close cooperation with </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Russia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Last   summer Nursultan Nazarbaev   was 60. He is a robust man, of above average height, who looks younger than his years. He has an energetic   handshake, an attentive friendly aspect, expressive and metaphoric speech. The   school of life that this politician has experienced has made him competent in   many spheres. A good memory permits him to answer any question confidently. He   speaks about the potential of the country’s development for the coming thirty   years, about the details of important economic projects, recalling meetings with   leaders of other states.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   first president of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> spent his childhood in a picturesque mountain locality in the south. His father   was an agrarian and a passionate hunter. Together with his father, young Nursultan stealthily approached dangerous mountain cliffs   toward careful and strong <em>argali</em> –   the progenitors of home sheep. This hunting requires durability and courage. The   powerful beast (it is many times bigger than its tamed relative) exceeds man in everything – in sharpness of sight,   in scent, in speed. Only few hunters succeed in catching an argali. In this they are similar to only one member of the animal   kingdom – a </span><em><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">bars</span></em><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> (panther), representative of the cat family, brother of the tiger and the   leopard that lives high in the mountains. Only a <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">bars</span> capable of fighting an argali.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">From   his youth the image of a beautiful, strong and freedom-loving animal became for   Nursultan Nazarbaev the   incarnation of high moral ideals. Becoming a head of state he expressed his understanding of a dynamically   developing independent state in the short formula ‘a Central Asian </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">BARS</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is an analogue of the ‘Far Eastern tiger.’ </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Long   ago Nazarbaev began his working life as an employee at   a&nbsp; metallurgic   factory. He graduated as an engineer, then worked as a   party official at different levels, and finally at forty something became   prime-minister of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> when the republic was still a part of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Soviet   Union</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   Gorbachev planned to make him vice-president of the superstate and considered him one of the most talented   people in the then Soviet elite. History chose another scenario, but Nursultan Nazarbaev turned out to   be one of the most outstanding leaders even in the new era. He has an original   way of thinking and sees the future through the prism of proper images, like the   one of a proud <em><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Bars</span></em> that lives on the snowy mountains. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   resources of the huge state (Kazahkstan is almost 3   million square km in size) now assure the speedy rate of building up Astana.   Tomorrow, as Nazarbaev foresees, they will guarantee   an economic boom for the republic. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is one of the richest countries; there is plenty of petroleum, gas, copper,   lead, gold and many other valuable minerals. But Nazarbaev considers a favourable geopolitical position,   making </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> a bridge between the West and the East, a still a greater wealth. It was here   that the legendary </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Silk   Road</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   which in antiquity tied </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">China</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> with </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Europe</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   passed through. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">This   year for the first time considerable production and GDP growth has been posted, resulting from the reasonable investment   policy conducted by the leadership of the country. Foreign companies have found   a favourable investment climate and many spheres of application for their   capital. One example of the involvement of big corporations in the Kazakh   economy is the Caspian Pipeline Consortium project. Major petroleum companies   from all over the world joined in the building of a pipeline from deposits in   the Kazakh deserts to the Russian Black Sea port. The investments required are estimated to run into billions of dollars, but the   incomes will also make up an astronomical sum. Construction of the pipeline   is slated to begin next summer.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Nowadays   petroleum brings in about a third of state budget revenue. However, volatility   on the world energy market can prevent Nazarbaev from   realising his plan to transform </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> into a Central Asian panther. Thus, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> set itself a three-year development plan with the goal of posting just seven per   cent industrial output growth. This year the fulfilment of a five year plan, with larger-scale aims, will begin. On the   question of how he sees </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> in 2030, Nazarbaev answers that it will be a developed   country with a numerous and influential middle class as a base for stability,   where there will be no poverty and shocking social contrasts. As a supporter of   market economy, Nazarbaev favours an active role for   the state in market regulation with the help of legislative tax measures and   tariff policy for the state power and gas networks and the   railroads.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Besides   economic difficulties, Nazarbaev is   faced with social obstacles to dynamic development. Corruption is a   familiar phenomenon in the power structures of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   Nazarbaev is not a magician, he is not capable of   transforming the mentality of the army of functionaries, who grew up in a time   when bosses were almighty and citizens were deprived of   rights. He is perfectly aware of the danger of uncontrolled authorities for   reforms and for the future state. He is also worried about the struggle against   criminality that plagues the former Soviet states.</span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Nazarbaev</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> considers stability in the Central Asian region a condition for successful   development. Therefore, he pays a great attention to foreign policy, trying to   interest the most influential states in the affairs of the region and to involve   them in economic and political interrelations. Much of his foreign policy is aimed at making the most of the good geopolitical position   of the country. For example, a treaty on the borders between </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kazakhstan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">China</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> that for some decades had been an object of dispute between the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Soviet   Union</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">China</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> has been signed. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   policy of openness and peace brings its fruit, with stability inside the country   and in foreign policy gaining the trust of external investors and international   financial institutes. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Rather   considerable aid is given by friendly states,   especially Islamic ones. </span></p>
        <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">If   the entire republic develops at the same rate as the new capital, the dream of   the president Nazarbaev of the “Central Asian </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Bars</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">”   will soon become a reality.</span></p>

          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">“Asiaweek”, an influential magazine published in Hong-Kong,   has for many years published ratings for the mightiest   people of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   One can find the names of politicians, industrialists, media tycoons and   financiers. The name of Hassanal Bolkiah, sultan of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   has been placed among the top ten with an enviable   constancy. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is twice the size of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Luxembourg</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> (5765 sq. kilometres) and is situated in the northern part of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kalimantan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> island (</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Borneo</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">),   which has just over 300,000 inhabitants. Still, its ruler seems to be considered   as important as the leaders of the most populated and vast states of the modern   world. Until recently he was reputed the richest person on Earth. Was it this consideration that defined his high position in the   ratings?</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   sultan of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is a favourite of the Western press. He corresponds to the general idea of an   Oriental king: a generous and charming man of fortune – something between Harun ar-Rashid and an Indian   nabob. Just like a character from an Arab fairy tale. In Russian folklore a good and beneficent sovereign is also a common   figure.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Nonetheless, one cannot use the same   techniques that served folkloric personages to draw a portrait of the sultan of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   Undoubtedly, this personality is more interesting than an image created by the   diligence of the yellow press. As an heir to the most ancient of the ruling   dynasties of the world he is respected by patriarchs of world   policy, who can hardly be suspected to be complaisantly amazed by the riches of   a sultan. A man that has skilfully governed his state for more than   thirty years would be seen as an outstanding person   anywhere. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> occupies two enclaves in the northern coast of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kalimantan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> island. A country that is situated in a geopolitical   centre that has been disturbed almost without intermission by wars, revolutions,   economic tremors of a global scale, but maintains a remarkable stability and   demonstrates a steady growth in the quality of life. It is   situated at the very borderline of drawn out conflicts of interests   between super powers. The wars in Vietnam and Cambodia, the Spratly islands conflict, distempers in Indonesia and the   Philippines, an unprecedented strong economic crisis in 1997-1999 – the people   of Brunei and their leader have had reason enough to be   anxious.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   full title and name of the ruler of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> would take up some lines. One can read in it both the history of the country and   the respectful age of the dynasty to which the 29th sultan Muda Hassanal Bolkiah Muizzaddin Vaddaulah belongs. He was born on the 15th of   July of 1946, just a year after the country was   liberated from Japanese occupation. Hassanal’s father   was heir to the throne of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> at the time and ascended the throne under the name of Omar Ali Saifutdin III in 1950. The era of his ruling was dynamic in   every sense. The country went straight to independence, succeeded in achieving   equal rights in distributing oil incomes, obtained a   constitution and a parliament and the basic institutions of a modern state such   as an army, a finance system and mass media. Following his father’s example the future sultan Hassanal   learnt the art of governing the state from his childhood. He received an   excellent education: first he studied with private   teachers, then he finished the elite </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">college</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Victoria</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> (Kuala-Lumpur), and in 1966 he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Great   Britain</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   After two years in the school of the world military elite, Hassanal received his officer’s diploma and captain’s   stripes.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">No   sooner had the prince returned to his Motherland, was he faced with the daunting   task of taking over the throne. In October of 1967 Omar   Ali Saifutdin III declared his will to pass the throne   to his son. The sultan was still rather young and in good health, so his   abdication aroused many questions. One explanation was that he was pressured by </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Great   Britain</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   which was afraid to lose power over its rich protectorate. Nevertheless, Hassanal continued his father’s policy and constantly   strengthened the sovereignty of the state of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> in all fields, which eventually led to the declaration of independence on the   1st of January of 1984.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">It   was not only the resistance of the British authorities that complicated the   process of getting independence.</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> In 1962, when the crown-prince Hassanal was 16, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> was shaken by a mutiny, organised by the   left-nationalist People’s Party. The rebels’ main objective was to immediately   end British dominance and proclaim complete independence. The Indonesian   authorities of the time supported the People’s Party both morally and   financially, with a view to establishing full control over </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kalimantan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> in time. If the extremist forces had come to power then, events in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">North   Kalimantan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> would have taken quite a different turn, which materialised in some neighbouring   countries. But the deep traditions of nationhood and   the sultan’s cautious policies have become major factors of stability in the   society of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Not   only is the phenomenal stability of such a small country amazing, it also has   the ability be consistent in maintaining its political   course and vindicating its original way of development. Surrounded from all   sides by&nbsp; “Asian   Tigers”, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is strikingly different, both as a model of state organisation, and in its   cultural and moral atmosphere. The sultan has declared many times that the   monarchies of the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Persian   gulf</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> are his pattern, the ones that come closest of all to the ideal of an Islamic   state. But that does not mean that </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is copying the political systems of the marvellous six oil kingdoms and emirates   – in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> they are interested in preserving the ancient traditions of Malay nationhood and   national consciousness. What the sultanate and the Arab countries of the Gulf   have in common is the role of the Islam in society.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Bandar   Seri Bega</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">w</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">an</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is the most eastern of the Muslim capitals. Its features symbolize the idea of a   victorious Islam. Above opulent tropical green the   cupolas of the mosque named after Omar Ali Saifutdin   blister with gold. It is one of the biggest edifices of its kind in the world.   In contrast to the neighbouring countries of Malay Muslim culture that use the Latin alphabet, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> uses Arab letters. The sale of spirits is prohibited,   they have stricter rules on Islamic morals than their neighbours and Sharia law operates. Still, the population has all the   benefits of modern civilisation, with superb infrastructure, medical services   and educational system. Everything is free of charge. Moreover, the sultan’s   subjects don’t pay any income tax. Nowadays, the   national gross product totals almost 15 thousand USD per capita. This level   is seen in the most flourishing European countries. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   state ideology of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is Melayu Islam Beraja   (MIB). Its historical analogy is the Russian three-in-one formula “orthodoxy,   autocracy, people’s spirit”, which reflected the aspiration of Russian tsars to   build state life on the basis of religion, authority of   hereditary power and nationalism. Here is an official concise formula that sums   up this ideology: “It has become the nation's formal guiding light and as a way   of life for Brunei Darussalam. It is a blend of Malay language, culture and   Malay customs, the teaching of Islamic laws and values and the monarchy system which must be esteemed and practised by all. Islam is   tolerant of all religions so the MIB philosophy cannot be   viewed as a force that stifles the practice of other religions. Rather it   is a vehicle by which other religions can carry on their religious practices and   rites as usual with the respect and peace they deserve”.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Monarchy   as ideology has deep roots in the country. The Bolkiah   dynasty has ruled here for over 600 years. During this time </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> has known periods of power, years of decay and the revivals that followed. When   the flotillas of European countries appeared in the seas of south-eastern </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   the sultans of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> controlled all of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Kalimantan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> (the 750,000 square km island is one of the biggest in the world) and a part of   the </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Philippines</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> archipelago. One can say that by the 16th century </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> had become a regional hegemon. The colonial expansion   of the Portuguese, Spanish, British, Dutch and French led to the enslavement of   almost all the countries of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">South   East Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> kept its independence longer than any other country and from time to time did   considerable damage to the European armies. But over   several centuries of opposition the sultanate lost most of its territory, and by   1888 when the British protectorate over </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> was established, less than 10,000 square kilometres were left of the once   extensive state. But even then its neighbours (until   1905) continued with territorial take-overs. But, as if   to compensate for the losses, the sultanate turned out to own the richest oil   deposits.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Prior   to the recent financial crisis that affected </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Southeast   Asia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   the future of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> looked calm. Because of its shortage in manpower   resources, the government of the sultanate had invested huge sums in the   economies of neighbouring countries, especially </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Malaysia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Indonesia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   The economic typhoon hit right at them. </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Thailand</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Korea</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Japan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">’s   most important economic partners, also suffered. At the same time the price of oil plummeted. The subjects of the sultan   may not have felt an immediate effect from the crisis, but the country’s foreign   assets notably reduced.&nbsp; The results   could have been catastrophic, but for the provident policy of Hassanal Bolkiah, who had started   long before to place considerable means in different foreign banks, and to   invest in real estate, industry and high technology. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   sultanate has long ago waved good-bye to the era, when power and a country’s   importance depended on its population and size. Buying companies in different   countries, </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> considerably augments its budget and manages to solve problems that would be   difficult to quickly resolve with only its home   resources. Thus, by buying some big ranches in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Australia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">,   the government has immediately assured massive supplies of meat on the market of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> and has got rid of the necessity to spend money   importing food that is not produced to sufficient quantity in the   sultanate. Investments in hotels, holiday resorts and the entertainment industry   in different regions of the world enables the country to avoid direct dependence   on the state of the economy in the proper region. Globalisation promises   countries such as </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> even greater possibilities. But the monarch sees both   the pluses and minuses of this process. At the beginning of September, an   English-language newspaper “Borneo Bulletin” reported that: “His Majesty the Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam warned that although   globalisation could lead to an improved quality of life and higher standards of   living, it can also bring about the marginalisation of the developing and the   less developed countries”. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The   recent events in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Indonesia</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> show that neither rich nature resources, nor a powerful army or police guarantee   internal stability – an external crisis can instantly aggravate the problems have been accumulating in a country   for years. The sultan of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> tries to stay in touch with his subjects and almost every week he meets with   people in an informal atmosphere. He visits mosques and public events, sees oil   field workers and dayak   tribes, who live in the jungle in the south of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">. </span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Notwithstanding   its size, the country is very diversified in every   sense. The languages, religions and traditions of all the peoples and races that   have contributed in the building of the modern state, maintain their vital   force, and national or religious conflicts are out of question. The same can be said about social relations. Though it was not always like that – in the times of the British protectorate   there were manifestations over price hikes and extraordinary measures were   introduced.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The   results of the 33-year rule of Sultan </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Bolkiah</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"> arouses   a deep respect in </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Asia</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">, where   the sultan of </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"> has for   a long time been a central cultural figure turning the clock of history.   Throughout the world the success of such a small   country through modernization has stimulated much interest in </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"> and its   leader. In </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Russia</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"> where   monarchic support is becoming stronger and where new parties and organizations   keep appearing that are attempting to restore </span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Russia</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">'s   historical heritage, the dynamic development of the sultanate is viewed as convincing evidence of the great potential of   monarchic rule. In our country where the monarchy existed for 1,155 years, and   the communist dictatorship 73 years, examples of successfully developing   dynastic regimes are by many seen as a model for the   future.</span></p>
          <p><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">On   the threshold of the new millennium a representative   forum will take place in the capital of </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   An Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum will be held on the 15th   and 16th of November in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Bandar   Seri Begawan</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">.   President Vladimir Putin leads the Russian delegation.   Seven thousand guests will arrive in </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> to take part in different APEC commissions and to cover the event in the world   mass media. The </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Pacific   Ocean</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> region is forecast to become a global centre in the   nearest future, where new ideas will be conceived and modern models of   development will be exercised. In this region with a very variegated racial,   cultural and national composition a major part of   mankind now lives. But even though it is   surrounded by the most powerful of states, small </span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Brunei</span><span lang="EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB"> is seen as an important link in all international organisations. And this is due to the great personal merit of its dynamic   leader, sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. </span></p>
